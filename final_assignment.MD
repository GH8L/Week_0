## Student Career Goal Statement 

  
I've always seen myself as someone who works in a detailed field , one where I can be as detail-oriented as possiable.
Allowing myself to be that person who's infatuated with their job.For me, that career path could be. Data science, it's one of the most
unpredicted field, it's the mixture of AI and could be in fintech. and I'm grateful to know the basics in this field.
When years pass by, I'll probably have published at least one or two research papers or a book dedicated to this field, branched out of
computer science. And to be that scientist who they think of when data science comes to their mibd.there's so much yet to learn and to
create hopefully I have the time and energy for it.and the rest comes with this journey.
For fintech field i'm really intrested in modern banking/banks in general. I haven't yet seen one platfrom/technology that could manage
more than one bank account at the same time / using AI to transfer money by dates(there  could be banks that do so / paypal has this feature i gess but for banks in saudi I haven't seen any yet) /Machine learning.
